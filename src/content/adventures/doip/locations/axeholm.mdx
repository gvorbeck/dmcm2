    ##### Occupants
    * 18 [Dwarf Ghouls](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/ghoul) [The fortress contains three dwarf ghouls plus three additional ghouls for each character in the party, not including sidekicks]
        * If these ghouls are killed here, the PCs encounter no more of them in the fortress.

    ##### Environment
    * **Axeholm’s** primary entrance and exit is this defensible passage, which is blocked by a sturdy portcullis (see “Arrival” above).
    * Arrow slits are spaced along the walls and murder holes line the ceiling, enabling fortress defenders to shoot ballistas at invaders or pour boiling oil on top of them. With the **dwarves** gone, the only remaining defenses are the portcullis and the double doors to the south, _which are barred shut_.
    * PCs hoping to get through the double doors must break them down, which takes a single character 1 hour.
        * Multiple PCs working together can reduce the time proportionately.

    ##### Developments
    * The noise created by smashing down the doors is loud enough to alert all the **dwarf ghouls** in the fortress, which gather in **area 4** and _attack once the doors fall_.

    ##### XP
    * Split 14,400 xp for defeating the **ghouls** or opening the **portcullis** silently.

    ##### Occupants
    * Hiding behind the throne is a [ghoul](https://dndbeyond.com/monsters/ghoul) with **40 hit points**.

    * The hidden ghoul can be detected with a successful **DC 13 Wisdom (Perception)** check.

    ##### Developments
    * If any PC inspects the throne, the **ghoul** lets out a shriek and attacks.
        * Its shriek is heard by the ghouls in **area 26**, which crawl down the chimney and clamber out of the fireplace.
        * [**7 ghouls**] This group contains two soot-covered ghouls plus one additional ghoul for each member of the party, not including sidekicks.
            * After all other creatures in the hall have taken a first turn in combat, these ghouls join the battle, **acting on the same initiative count as the former castellan**.

    ##### Treasure
    * The **ghoulish castellan** wears a **gold signet ring** that bears the **Axeholm** crest: _a handaxe clutched in a dwarven gauntlet_.
        * The signet ring is worth 5 gp and unlocks the chest in **area 29**.

    * The door to the north has been smashed open, and its remains are strewn on the floor.
    ##### Developments
    * The stench of death and decay grows stronger as the PCs approach this room, and they can hear the hisses and snarls of the ghouls that lair here.
    * After dealing with the ghouls, the PCs can inspect the room more closely. Describe it to the players as follows:

    <div className="flavor">

    This chamber was once a shrine, as evidenced by wall carvings that depict dwarves carrying censers and observing religious rites. However, the eastern section of the room has collapsed, filling the area with rubble. Gnawed bones scattered among the debris are the remains of a number of dwarves.
    </div>

    ##### Treasure
    * PCs who search through the rubble in the eastern portion of the room find two treasures:
        * A platinum amulet on a thin but sturdy gold chain.
            * This amulet is a holy symbol of **Moradin** (the dwarven god of creation) and bears his symbol: a hammer and anvil.
                * **Any dwarf character recognizes the symbol** immediately, while a non-dwarf recognizes it with a successful **DC 10 Intelligence (Religion)** check.
        * An unlocked steel coffer weighing 5 lbs.
            * This small box is packed with silt, nestled in which is a [potion of superior healing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/potion-of-healing-superior).

    ##### Environment
    * Against the south wall of this otherwise empty room rests a **80-lb iron chest with clawed feet**. 
        * Its built-in lock bears a tiny circular indentation instead of a traditional keyhole. 
        * Close inspection of the indentation reveals a tiny symbol of a handaxe clutched in a gauntlet. 
            * This symbol matches the one on the castellan’s signet ring (found in **area 14**), albeit reversed.

---
* **Axeholm** is a dwarven fortress carved into the base of a mountain 15 miles south of **Phandalin**.
    * The site was abandoned and sealed up long years ago after being haunted by a banshee.
        * The restless spirit of a **moon elf** ambassador named **Vyldara** who tried and failed to foment civil unrest among the dwarves.
        * The dwarves imprisoned the elf and sent messages to her people, asking that they come to collect her.
        * Before envoys could be sent, **Vyldara** killed two guards trying to escape, only to be cut down by dwarven axes before she could succeed.
    * When the elf’s evil spirit started filling **Axeholm’s** halls with deathly wails, the dwarves abandoned their stronghold, but not before several dwarves slain by the **banshee** arose as **ghouls** to feed on their kin.
    * **Ghouls and other creatures** now prowl Axeholm, while the **banshee** continues to haunt the fortress’s upper halls.
    * The **banshee** senses the arrival of adventurers with its **Detect Life** trait.
        * In its twisted spectral mind, they are invaders who must be destroyed for their trespass.

#### AXEHOLM FEATURES

In the **dwarves’** absence, Axeholm has become a dark, sullen tomb, full of dust and bad memories. It’s quiet most of the time, except when the sorrowful wails of the **banshee** fill the place. The following features are common throughout.

* _**Arrow Slits**_. When using an arrow slit for protection, a creature gains **three-quarters cover** against outside threats. A **Medium character _can’t_ squeeze through an arrow slit**, but a **Small character _can_ with a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check**.
* _**Ballistas**_. For its defense, **Axeholm** relied heavily on ballistas — massive **crossbows that fire heavy bolts**. A crew of three dwarves operated each ballista. Before it can be fired, a ballista must be loaded and aimed. **It takes one action to load the weapon, one action to aim it, and one action to fire it**. _Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (<Dice>3d10</Dice>) piercing damage_.
* _**Ceilings**_. Ceilings throughout are 15-ft-high and flat, unless the text says otherwise.
* **_Chimneys_**. Fireplaces throughout Axeholm have chimneys cut from seamless stone. **Some of those chimneys can be used to gain access to the fortress**.
* **_Doors_**. Regular doors are made of thick, sturdy oak reinforced with iron bands and fitted with iron hinges and handles.
* **_Light_**. The walls are lined with torch sconces, but the torches burned down long ago. **Adventurers require darkvision or their own light sources to see inside**.
* **_Stench_**. A foul stench lingers in Axeholm, _becoming stronger as one gets closer to the resident ghouls_.

#### Travel to Axeholm
The day-long journey to **Axeholm** from **Phandalin** takes the characters across grassy lowlands that skirt the rocky foothills of the **Sword Mountains**. The trek passes without incident, though cool winds and rain blowing in from the **Sword Coast** make the trip far from pleasant.

#### Arrival
<div className="flavor">

Thrust out from the base of a dark gray mountain is the entrance to the dwarven fortress — a dark, fifteen-foot-wide passageway flanked by forty-foot-high bulwarks of smooth, seamless stone. An iron portcullis covered with rust blocks the entrance. Arrow slits carved into the bulwarks are dark, revealing no hint of occupation.
</div>

* The portcullis in **area 1** is too heavy to lift, and its bars are too narrowly spaced for even Small characters to squeeze through.
    * A Small character can squeeze through an arrow slit into **area 2 or 3**, then attempt to raise the portcullis using the winches there.
    * The winches are rusty and require **DC 15 Strength (Athletics)** to turn.
        * Each successful check allows the portcullis to be raised 5 feet.
* PCs who search for another entrance can attempt **DC 15 Wisdom (Perception)** checks.
    * A successful check spots numerous stone chimneys protruding from the mountainside, but an earthquake after Axeholm was abandoned closed off most of those to anything but Tiny creatures.
    * Only the chimneys leading down to **area 21 and area 23** can be accessed by the PCs.
        * Scaling the mountain requires **DC 10 Strength (Athletics)**, as there are plenty of handholds and footholds.
* Crawling down a chimney to **area 21 or area 23** requires another **DC 10 Strength (Athletics)**.
    * If this check fails, the PC falls 20 ft to the bottom of the chimney, landing in the sooty hearth and taking <Dice>2d6</Dice> bludgeoning damage.
    * PCs who use climbing gear to scale the mountain and lower themselves down a chimney have advantage on their checks.
