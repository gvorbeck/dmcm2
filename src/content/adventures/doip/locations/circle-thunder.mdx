    ##### Occupants
    * [**Flenz and Narux**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/anchorite-of-talos) are dancing.
    * 12 [Twig Blights](https://dndbeyond.com/monsters/twig-blight) are frolicking. [two blights for each character in the party, including sidekicks]
    * [Gorthok the Thunder Boar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/gorthok-the-thunder-boar) appears when the anchorites are dead.
    ##### Environment
    * Atop the hill is a ring of eight upright stone structures, each one consisting of two 10-foot-high vertical stone slabs spaced 5 feet apart and topped with a 3-foot-thick flat lintel stone.
        * These uprights can be toppled by creatures with a combined _**Strengt**h score of 80 or higher_.
    * In the middle of the circle, two humanoid figures (**Flenz and Narux**) dance around a deer carcass, each wearing the rotting head of a boar as a mask.
    * **Flenz and Narux** are either performing a ritual to summon **Gorthok the Thunder Boar**, or they are making a sacrifice to appease **Talos** and call forth a storm.
    * **Secret Trapdoors**. Any character who searches the hilltop and succeeds on a **DC 10 Wisdom (Perception)** check finds one of three flimsy wooden trapdoors hidden under the grass and dirt. Below these trapdoors are tunnels leading to **areas 2, 3, and 4**.
    ##### Developments
    * If the characters have not yet defeated **Gorthok**, the boar arrives _once both anchorites are dead_, appearing out of nowhere in the middle of the circle with a thunderclap. **Gorthok** fights to the death.

##### Overview
The reclusive **anchorites of the Circle of Thunder** gather on this hill to make sacrifices to **Talos the storm god**. In stormy weather, the **anchorites** also perform rituals to summon **Gorthok the Thunder Boar**, a destructive force they can unleash against their enemies. A circle of standing stones atop the hill helps to focus the **anchorites**’ magic to make the summoning of **Gorthok** possible.

Three anchorites — **Flenz, Narux, and Yargath** — defend the hill. When not performing rituals in the circle of standing stones, they patrol the surrounding woods, forage for food, and lurk in caves dug out of the hillside. When the PCs arrive, the anchorites are gathered on the hilltop. If **Gorthok** has not been defeated yet, the anchorites are in the midst of summoning the great boar. Otherwise, they are conjuring a storm.

<h5 id="caves">Caves</h5>

Three caves are set beneath the hilltop, each serving as the lair of an anchorite of **Talos**. The caves are dug out of the earth, with each cave mouth braced by two rectangular stone slabs topped with a heavy lintel stone. All the caves have 7-foot-high ceilings and crude wooden gates for doors. Each cave features a different layout but has similar contents.

* **Entryway**. Situated in the middle of this intersection, facing the cave mouth, the skull of a boar rests atop a pile of humanoid and animal bones. A character who succeeds on a **DC 10 Intelligence (Religion)** check can ascertain that the bones are a warning to stay away.
* **Boar Pen**. The gate to this room is lashed shut with rope. It holds a boar that is the anchorite’s companion and garbage disposal. The boar can’t harm anyone while trapped in this room. If the gate is opened by anyone other than an anchorite of **Talos**, the boar tries to flee the cave, attacking anyone in its path.
* **Cell**. The gate to this cell is lashed shut with rope. The cell is used to hold animals doomed to be sacrificed in rituals to **Talos**. There’s a 25 percent chance (1d4) that a harmless deer is trapped inside. Otherwise, the cell is empty.
* **Anchorite’s Retreat**. This unfurnished room serves as the anchorite’s quarters. Niches in the walls hold clay dishware, wooden utensils, gathered berries, bundled herbs, and creepy totems. In **areas 2 and 3**, the anchorites have hidden treasure buried under the earthen floor in a random 5-foot square. See those areas for details of the treasure.
* **Secret Exit**. This tunnel slopes up to a secret trapdoor that is plainly visible from the underside.

##### Travel to the Circle
###### Tree Trap

<div className="flavor">

You come upon a sixty-foot-wide forest clearing, in the middle of which is a black, needle-like spire — a forty-foot-tall pine tree ravaged by fire long ago, its limbs burned off. Tied to the dead tree near its base are several ghastly dolls made of twigs bound with black hair.
</div>

* Ten twig dolls are bound to the charred tree, all within easy reach.
    * A **detect magic spell** reveals an aura of transmutation magic emanating from the tree and the ground in a 60-ft radius around it.
* Close examination of a twig doll reveals something wrapped inside it.
    * By breaking a doll apart, characters can see that it contains a still-beating pig’s heart.
    * Any damage to a heart kills it and causes the dead tree’s roots to magically animate and erupt from the ground.
* When the constricting roots erupt, each creature standing in the clearing must succeed on a **DC 12 Dexterity saving throw** or take 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage and be _restrained_.
    * The creature takes this damage again at the start of each of its turns until it escapes.
    * A creature can use an action to free itself or another creature within its reach with a successful **DC 15 Strength (Athletics)** check, or by dealing 5 or more slashing damage against a root with a _single melee weapon attack_.
    * The roots have AC 13 and immunity to all damage except slashing.

###### Yargath's Patrol

<div className="flavor">

As you make your way across uneven ground rising to a ridge, several hulking orcs ascend a similar ridge across from you, separated from you by a sixty-foot-wide, ten-foot-deep gully. The orcs unleash terrible battle cries as they are joined by a humanoid with elongated claws.
</div>

* On the first round of combat, [Yargath](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/anchorite-of-talos) casts **bless on up to three orcs**. Meanwhile, the **orcs** charge across the ravine and close to melee range.
* **Treasure**. Yargath carries a [potion of greater healing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/potion-of-healing-greater).

##### Arrival
<div className="flavor">

Ominous storm clouds gather in the sky as you approach a ninety-foot-tall hill with trees spreading across its slopes. Atop the hill is a large ring of standing stones. Two ghastly figures dance within this henge, surrounded by a number of smaller capering creatures.
</div>
