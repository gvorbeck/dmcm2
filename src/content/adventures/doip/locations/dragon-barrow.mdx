<div className="flavor">

</div>

* _At night_, **Will-o'-wisps** emerge from Secret Entrance (**area 1**) using their _Incorporeal Movement_ and float above the barrow, hoping to attract prey.

### CATACOMBS FEATURES

A series of chambers and tunnels at ground level form the catacombs beneath the barrow mound. They reek of damp earth and stale, deathly air.

* **_Ceilings_**. Ceilings throughout are 8-ft-high and flat.
* **_Earthen Construction_**. All tunnels and rooms have walls, floors, and roofs made of packed earth.
* **_Light_**. There is no light within the barrow. PCs require darkvision or their own light sources to see inside.
* **_Sarcophagi_**. The sarcophagi found throughout the catacombs are carved from solid blocks of granite and sealed with heavy granite lids. The seals are airtight. Lifting a lid requires **DC 20 Strength (Athletics)**. Each lid is a Medium object with **AC 17, 12 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage**.
