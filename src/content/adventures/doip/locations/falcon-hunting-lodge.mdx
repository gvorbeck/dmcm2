#### Background
* **Falcon the Hunter** maintains this hunting lodge to cater to nobles from **Neverwinter**.
* He offers his services as a guide to those nobles, most of whom wouldn’t last long in the forest without his protection and survival skills.
* **Falcon** abhors city life, preferring a rustic existence and simple pleasures.
    * His lodge has all the creature comforts he requires, though he never turns down a good bottle of wine (or even a bad one) from a visitor.
* **Falcon** has two retainers: an elderly, world-weary cook named **Corwin**, and a mute twelve-year-old stablehand named **Pell**.
    * Both are noncombatants.
* **Falcon** politely declines any offer to join the characters on a quest, stating that he must remain at the lodge in case nobles from **Neverwinter** come looking for his services.
* In addition to the main house, the hunting lodge grounds include a guest house for visitors, a conjoined stable house and smithy, an outhouse, and pens to hold **Falcon’s** livestock.
* Accustomed to long and lonely winters, **Falcon** keeps a season’s worth of provisions in his pantry at all times, supplementing those stores with fresh game.
    * He has also begun hunting **orcs** and mounting their heads in his trophy hall.
        * **Corwin** has advised **Falcon** not to do this for fear of retaliation, but **Falcon** has a long history of killing **orcs** and can’t abide them as neighbors.
* Visitors are free to stay in the guest house and dine with **Falcon** at no charge.
* For discriminating guests, **Falcon** offers a comfortable private room in the main lodge (**area 12**) for 10 gp a night.

#### Arrival
<div className="flavor">

A thin fog surrounds a fortified compound standing in a clearing on the east side of a narrow river. A ten-foot-high log palisade surrounds the compound, whose main building is a two-story stone-and-wood affair with a high-pitched roof, gables, window shutters, and a stone chimney. Attached to the main building is a blocky tower of gray stone, its high roof lined with battlements. Other structures include a two-story stable house and a gatehouse whose flat roof is enclosed by iron railings. A stone bridge spans the river, ending before an oaken door set into the gatehouse’s outer wall. Mounted next to the door is a bell with a short rope hanging from its clapper.
</div>

* _If the characters announce their arrival_ by ringing the bell or yelling over the walls, **Corwin** makes his way over to assess them from the gatehouse, slides back the heavy wooden bar securing the outside door, and lets them in.
* _If the characters have horses or pack animals_, **Corwin** has **Pell** look after them while he shows the characters to the guest house (**area 3**) to store their gear.
    * He then leads them to the dining and trophy hall (**area 11**) before fetching **Falcon**, who is usually in his quarters at **area 13**.

#### Roleplaying Falcon
* **Falcon the Hunter** wears a fur-lined cloak over his studded leather armor.
    * He stands 6'6", and has black hair and broad shoulders.
    * His eyes are as blue, cold, and sharp as ice, and he sports a neatly trimmed beard.
    * **Falcon** moves with the casual confidence of one who fears nothing, and he greets every concern with nonplussed indifference.
    * He loves good wine and treats other people as he would like to be treated — fairly and with patience.
* **Falcon**’s real name is **Carp Alderleaf** ~~Gustaf Stellern~~, but he has long since abandoned it.
    * His hunting skills have earned him the name he now bears.
    * Given the chance, he shares the following useful information with the characters:

- “I’ve seen more orcs in the woods of late. Ugly brutes.”
- “The orcs appear to be in league with the evil half-orcs that dwell southeast of here. These half-orcs are often seen in the company of little stick creatures known to creep about these woods. All in all, a nasty lot.”
- “The half-orcs dwell in a ruined stone manse overgrown with vines, roughly ten miles from here. Tales say that the manse was built by a scholar who studied the elven ruins scattered throughout these woods.”

</div>

#### Features
* **Animal Pens**. The pens extend east from the south yard and are divided by wooden fences. They hold two dozen chickens and a rooster, six pigs, and four goats. The animals are well treated and not dangerous.
* **Ceilings**. Interior ceilings are 9 feet high and flat.
* **Doors**. Doors are made of sturdy oak fitted with iron handles and hinges. Exterior doors are barred from the inside. A creature can use an action to force open a barred door with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. Each door is a Medium object with AC 15, 30 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.
* **Light**. At sundown, Corwin lights oil lanterns that hang from hooks on the walls in all interior locations.
* **Palisade**. The log palisade is 10 feet high and designed to keep wild forest animals at bay, not hold off armies. A character can scale a palisade wall with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.
