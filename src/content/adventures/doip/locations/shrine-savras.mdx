    ##### Environment
    * Rows of crumbling pillars support the 40-ft-high vaulted ceiling of this hall. 
    * Humanoid bones litter the dusty floor, and a 10-foot-square hole in the ceiling leads to the belfry. 
    * No rope hangs from the bell, which appears to be made of untarnished copper. 
    * The belfry can be reached from outside by climbing the outer walls and rooftop, which requires a successful **DC 15 Strength (Athletics)** check. 
    * Characters can reach the belfry from inside using magic such as a spider climb or fly spell.
    ##### Treasure
    * Close examination of the bell reveals that it’s thin sides are solid gold covered with peeling copper paint. 
    * The bell, which is 3 feet wide and weighs 50 pounds, hangs from an iron fixture bolted to a wooden crossbeam. 
    * A character with carpenter’s tools or smith’s tools can use them to detach the bell from the beam in 1 minute. 
    * Any creature under the bell when it falls must succeed on a **DC 12 Dexterity** check to get out of the way, or take 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage. 
    * The gold bell is worth 2,500 gp.

  flavor: |
    Six stone pillars brace the vaulted ceiling of this temple, the floor of which is buried under a thick layer of dust. Also covered in dust are four humanoid skeletons in tattered priestly vestments, lying near a stone altar situated in an alcove under four narrow windows. Carved into the front of the altar is a humanoid eye.
  content: |
    ##### Environment
    * A detect magic spell reveals an aura of divination magic around the altar. 
    * If Cryovain has been slain, nothing happens when a character touches the altar. 
    * Otherwise, any character touching the altar experiences a vision lasting 1 minute, during which time the character is incapacitated. 
        * In the vision, the character floats through the roof of the shrine, soars toward Icespire Hold, and sees the white dragon asleep on the fortress’s rooftop. (The divination power of the altar is effectively telling the characters where they must go to defeat the dragon.) A character receives this vision only once. Nothing happens to a character who touches the altar a second time.
    ##### Treasure
    * Any character who searches the altar and succeeds on a **DC 10 Wisdom (Perception)** check realizes that the altar’s base doesn’t quite touch the floor. 
        * The altar has stone rollers built into it and can be pushed 3 feet to the south, revealing an unlocked wooden coffer tucked inside a 1-foot-square cavity in the floor. 
        * This coffer contains 57 gp and a [mystery key](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/mystery-key).

#### Background
* 5 miles south of **Conyberry** is a shrine dedicated to [Savras](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Savras), god of divination and fate. 
    * Many years ago, the shrine’s priest-seers foresaw a elven ~~barbarian~~ attack on **Conyberry**, giving some of the townsfolk time to escape. 
        * Not all the townsfolk chose to flee, but those who did went to the shrine and brought much of the town’s gold with them.
        * The elves ~~barbarians~~ eventually tracked the townsfolk to the shrine, besieged it, and slaughtered everyone inside. In the days leading up to this final battle, the priest-seers helped the townsfolk hide their gold in plain sight. 
            * They melted down the coins and recast them into a bell, which they painted and hung in the shrine’s belfry (replacing the old iron bell). The gold bell hangs there to this day.
* Over the years, many other creatures have occupied the shrine. Most recently, a gang of **wererats** laired here until they were driven out by **orcs** displaced by **Cryovain** the white dragon. 
* Recently, **ogres** wandered by the shrine, saw the **orcs**, and decided to join them.

#### Arrival
<div className="flavor">
  
A ruin stands in the middle of a vast field north of the rocky foothills of the Sword Mountains. An old stone temple with a belfry jutting from its peaked roof is enclosed by stone walls, many sections of which have collapsed. The trail ends at a crumbling gatehouse, the doors to which were sundered long ago. Three of the four towers that once stood at the corners of the outer walls have collapsed. Only the northeast tower remains, and a guard stands atop it.
</div>

* The guard spotted atop the northeast tower (**area 6**) is an **orc**. 
* _During the day_, the characters can’t approach the shrine without being seen by this sentry, as there are no places to hide in the level field surrounding the shrine. 
* _If the characters wait until nightfall_, clouds obscure the moon and enable them to approach unseen, as long as they stay outside the 60-ft range of the **orc**’s darkvision. 
* _If the **orc** spots the characters_, it cries out, rousing the shrine’s other occupants. 
    * Once roused, all those occupants attack.
* The Enemy Roster table adjusts the number of **orcs and ogres** in the shrine based on the level of the characters and the number of characters in the party, not counting sidekicks.
