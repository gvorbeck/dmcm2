    ##### Occupants
    * 3 [Anchorites of Talos](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/anchorite-of-talos) disguised as **boars**.
    * 6 [Boars](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/boar)
    ##### Environment
    * Nine boars graze in the pumpkin patches — one per patch.
        * Of these, six are actual boars.
        * The other three are anchorites of Talos in boar form.
    * **_Pumpkins_**. A **detect magic spell** reveals a dim aura of transmutation magic around each pumpkin.
        * As an action, a PC can carve open a pumpkin to reveal six servings of seeds within.
            * Any creature that eats a serving of pumpkin seeds as an action regains 1 hit point.
            * If a creature eats more than 5 servings of pumpkin seeds in 1 hour, it must succeed on a **DC 12 Constitution saving throw** or be poisoned for <Dice>1d4</Dice> hours.
    ##### Developments
    * The **anchorites** ignore the characters until they try to leave (see “**Leaving the Manse**”).
    * If the PCs attack a **boar**, it flees on its turn by darting into the nearby woods.
    * If the characters attack an **anchorite**, all of the boars and anchorites retaliate.
    * If you need to determine whether a boar is an anchorite or not, roll a <Dice>d6</Dice>. On a 5 or 6, the boar is an anchorite in disguise.

    Stone steps climb to a portico with a stone balcony overhanging it at a height of ten feet. Vines wrap around the balcony’s support pillars and its crumbling stone railing. The ground-floor entrance features a double door with a giant boar’s head crudely carved into it. An unmarred double door stands closed on the balcony.
  content: |
    ##### Environment
    * A character can climb up to the balcony with a successful **DC 15 Strength (Athletics)** check.
        * If another character assists, the check is made with advantage.

    * **_Trapped Stairs_**. The staircase climbs 10 ft to **area 14**. Its upper half has been weakened to the extent that it collapses under 50 pounds or more of weight.
        * A creature on the collapsing stairs must make a **DC 15 Dexterity saving throw** to avoid falling onto a bed of wooden spikes planted underneath the staircase. On a failed save, the creature lands on <Dice>1d6</Dice> wooden spikes, each one dealing <Dice>1d6</Dice> piercing damage.

    * A fireplace dominates the south side of the room, and a smashed wooden dining table lies in a heap in the eastern half of the room, surrounded by six broken chairs.
    * ~~If the characters met the shapechanged anchorite of Talos on the way to the loggers’ camp and let it get away (see “A Boar-ing Encounter”), small twig figures rest on the mantelpiece — one representing each party member (including sidekicks). These are twig blights that attack if they are touched or harmed.~~
    ##### Treasure
    * Amid the ruined furnishings is a tarnished silver candelabrum worth 25 gp.

    Stone steps lead down to a flagstoned courtyard that has a pillared arcade to the east. Seven windows on the upper level overlook the courtyard, in the middle of which is a five-foot-wide stone well with thick vines erupting from it.

    **[If the orcs in** area 18 **have not yet been dealt with, add the following:]**

    Guttural snorts and yells erupt from the southeast corner of the manse, signaling the presence of orcs nearby.

    ##### Occupants
    * 6 [Vine Blights](https://dndbeyond.com/monsters/vine-blight) hide in the wellshaft. [one blight plus one additional blight for each member of the party, not including sidekicks (maximum five blights)]
        * The blights form a descending column, with the closest one 5 feet below the well’s mouth.
        * With their blindsight, they can sense intruders in the courtyard.
        * They emerge to attack only when they or the **Gulthias tree** take damage, or when **Grannoc** (see **area 10**) commands them to do so.
    ##### Environment
    * PCs who understand the Orc language can overhear the orcs planning some sort of attack.
    * **Gulthias Tree**. The well, which is 30 ft deep, contains a Gulthias tree, the roots of which extend deep underground.
        * With little room to spread out, the tree has grown into a malformed column of twisted wood with narrow gaps between its curling branches.
        * The Gulthias tree is a Huge plant with blood for sap.
        * It has AC 15, 250 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and no actions, reactions, or defenses.
        * It regrows from its roots even if it’s reduced to 0 hit points, regaining 1 hit point every 24 hours.
        * On any night when the moon is blood red, the **Gulthias tree** can spawn <Dice>2d6</Dice> **twig blights**, <Dice>1d6</Dice> **needle blights**, or <Dice>1d4</Dice> **vine blights**. These blights split from the tree and crawl out of the well, ready to do **Grannoc’s** bidding.
    ##### Developments
    * **Sounding the Alarm**. Any loud noise in the courtyard alerts the creatures in **areas 10 and 18**. Roll initiative for these creatures and the **vine blights** in the well, and have them react as follows:
        * **Grannoc** and the **twig blights** in **area 10** investigate immediately.
            * On their first turn, they enter the courtyard, whereupon **Grannoc** commands the **vine blights** to emerge from the well.
            * **Grannoc and the blights** then use their actions to attack their nearest foes.
            * The **orcs** in **area 18** use their first turn to drop down into **area 9**.
                * They barge through the door and join the battle on their second turn.

    This room was once a bedchamber, kitchen, and dining room rolled into one. Four beds stand along the south wall, with shuttered windows and nightstands between them. Against the west wall are four wardrobes and a cabinet full of plain dishware and cutlery. Four chairs surround a small dining table in the northeast corner, and a trestle table strewn with pots and cooking utensils stands near a blackened fireplace. All the furnishings are made of wood.

    The ceiling in the southwest corner of the room has collapsed, filling the area below with debris and leaving a jagged hole through which the room above is visible.

    ##### Environment
    * The wizard who built the manse had four apprentices.
    * When it became clear that the wizard wasn’t coming back, the apprentices pillaged the library (**area 11**) and fled, taking their personal belongings with them.
    * Any loud noise in this area alerts the **orcs** in **area 18**.
        * On their first turn, they drop down through the hole in the ceiling. On the following turn, they attack.
    * PCs can move tall furniture underneath the hole and climb up it to reach **area 18** without having to make an ability check.

    ##### Environment
    * Any PC who succeeds on a **DC 15 Intelligence (Religion)** check recognizes the symbol as that of **Talos, the evil god of storms**. A cleric with the Tempest domain succeeds on the check automatically.
    ##### Developments
    * If the PCs manage to get this far without alerting **Grannoc**, they catch him performing a ritual:
    <div className="flavor">

    Where the lightning bolts converge, a half-orc wearing hide armor performs an eerie dance while consuming the entrails of a dead possum. Standing around the half-orc are several small twig figures.
    </div>
    * PCs who watch **Grannoc** without alerting or interrupting him can determine that he’s performing a ritual with a successful **DC 15 Intelligence (Religion)** check. **Grannoc** hopes **Talos** will answer his prayers and rain destruction down upon **Falcon’s Hunting Lodge**. Any interruption by the characters spoils the ritual and incurs **Grannoc’s** wrath.
    ##### Treasure
    * **_Map_**. Grannoc has a map scrawled on the torn-off flap of a leather satchel. It shows **Neverwinter Wood** and marks the location of the **Circle of Thunder**.

    This room has a ten-foot-high wooden balcony forming its upper level, reached by a wooden spiral staircase curling down to the flagstone floor. Tall, empty bookcases line the walls, their shelves mostly bowed and broken. On the lower level, east of two pillars, are four old desks with chairs tucked behind them. A few moldy books are scattered about.

---
#### Background
* Many years ago, a half-elf wizard interested in the exploration of ancient elven ruins built a stone house in Neverwinter Wood, not far from several ruins that piqued her interest.
    * In the course of her explorations, the wizard disappeared, and the protective magical wards on her home expired.
        * The house fell into disrepair, then eventually into ruin. Ivy has all but engulfed it in the years since.
* Recently, a half-orc anchorite of Talos named **Grannoc** took over the ruined house and planted seeds at the bottom of its well.
    * From these seeds, a malignant tree grew to fill the well and began spawning evil plant monsters called **blights**.
        * The blights obey **Grannoc**, who uses them to defend his woodland manse and kill trespassers within the forest.
#### Features
* **_Ceilings_**. Ceilings on the ground floor are 8 feet high and flat. Second-floor ceilings are 15 feet high and peaked, with wooden rafters crossing below them at a height of 10 feet.
* **_Doors_**. Normal doors are made of wood, and are so rotted as to be soft and easily breakable (no ability check required). Secret doors are made of stone and blend in with the surrounding walls. _A secret door can be found by a character who searches the surrounding wall and succeeds on a **DC 10 Wisdom (Perception)** check_.
* **_Ivy_**. The ivy enveloping the manse is poisonous and makes the walls difficult to climb. Scaling a wall requires a successful **DC 15 Strength (Athletics)** check. A creature that comes into contact with ivy must succeed on a **DC 12 Constitution saving throw** or take 2 (<Dice>1d4</Dice>) poison damage.
* **_Light_**. Most locations on the ground floor are dark, as the ivy blocks out the natural light except in areas that are open to the sky (such as the courtyard) or that have openings through which sunlight or moonlight can enter. Rooms and halls on the upper level are dimly lit by natural light that filters through holes in the roof.
* **_Windows_**. Windows are 2½-foot wide, 5-foot-high apertures with wooden shutters but no glass. Those along the outside walls are covered with ivy, which must be cleared away before the shutters can be opened or closed.
#### Arrival
<div className="flavor">

Following a trail through the woods, you come to a foggy clearing, in the midst of which stands a crumbling two-story manse all but hidden beneath thorny ivy. The large house is set atop a six-foot-high stone foundation, and the main entrance has a balcony above it. Pumpkins grow wild in patches around the manse, with several wild boars feeding among them. The boars snort with contempt as you draw near.
</div>

#### Leaving the Manse
* When the PCs finish exploring the manse, they are attacked as they make their exit.
    * The attacking force consists of any **anchorites of Talos and boars** in **area 1** that were not previously killed or forced to flee.
    * In addition, 10 [needle blights](https://dndbeyond.com/monsters/needle-blight) emerge from the woods to join the battle [— two blights for each character in the party, not including sidekicks.]
#### Counterattack!
The day after the characters attack the manse, dark clouds settle over **Neverwinter Wood** as the **anchorites of Talos** stage a counterattack against **Falcon’s Hunting Lodge**. **Gorthok the Thunder Boar** smashes through the lodge’s palisade, allowing **twenty orcs** to storm the lodge.

If the characters aren’t present when the lodge is attacked, **Falcon** and his servants flee on Falcon’s riding horse and make their way to **Phandalin**, surrendering the lodge to the **orcs**.
