<div class="flavor">

Each of you stands in the same darkened cavern of **Wave Echo Cave**. Around you lay the still quivering bodies of the creatures that last tasted your blades. After so long in this lightless cavity, you barely register the rythmic crashing of unseen waves that echo throughout every hallway. **Astra Katernin Nemetsk Van Der Stahalsen** looks at the stone floor below her feet and notices a strange engraving. She squats and brushes away centuries of dust to reveal an egraved image of the small golden box she found near the entrance. Around the engraving are a set of Gnomish characters. The Gnome, **Qyryz Willowdown**, stands at eye-level with the squatting Astra and reads over the Human's shoulder.

"It says, '_Bring the Shadow Box to this place, if this cave you wish to erase. Quickly now - move as thunder, before this place is wrought asunder._'"

Astra looks over at Qyryz with a confused expression. "Do you think it's talking about the Doomix Cube?" she asks, holding the golden cube in her palm. The question still lingers in the air when the box and the engraving on the floor begind to glow.

**Edgarr** looks away from the map he's found inside a Dwarven book and points at a cluster of small rocks dancing on the ground. The floor begins to shake and there is a faint rumbling that can be heard between the crashing waves. The engraving begins to crack. "There's your answer. Now _move_!"

**Xanaphia Umara** and **Lyraethyl Lichwynd** have already grabbed their gear and started running, a small flame Xanaphia's hand lights their way through the crumbling passages.
</div>

#### **_QUEST: ESCAPE WAVE ECHO CAVE VIA SKILL CHALLENGE_**

* Begin a **Skill Challenge** to escape **Wave Echo Cave**.
    * Start DC at 10. For each success, raise DC by 1.
    * PCs need 5 success before 3 failures.
    * Failures can result in being injured by falling rocks, hitting dead ends, cave-ins blocking their path, falling into pits.
    * As PCs exit cave "just in time," mention that WEC will be partially accessible in the future, but that some parts will be forever lost.
* PCs dust themselves off and assess their injuries as four figures wearing green cloaks approach them.
    * **Berinon Bladewalker** raises a hand and points to the copper clasps on Lyraethyl and Qyryz's cloaks.

<div class="flavor">

Four figures stand before you in the light of the morning sun. Each are draped in shimmering green cloak with hoods pulled over their heads. One of them steps foward and lowers his hood revealing himself to be a middle-aged human male with long tangled dark hair and beard. He has a wide face with a scar trailing across the bridge of his nose. He has a serious look on his face as he points out to your group and calls out, "We look for the Elf known as Lyraethyl Lichenwynd and the Gnome Qyryz Willowdown." The three behind him star out at you in silence.

**[wait for Q and L to identify themselves]**

The man nods as he sees the leaf-shaped copper clasps given to you by Reidoth when you joined the Emerald Enclave. "Reidoth sent us. We are fellow members of the Emerald Enclave. I am Berinon Bladewalker. It is time to prove yourselves to the Enclave."
</div>

* Reidoth is dead. He had been suffering from tumors for the last year.
    * Desperate for a cure, he came to **Thundertree** with two motivations:
        * Rid the region of the young green dragon **Venomfang**.
        * Find and consume the dragon's eggs, hoping they would cure the tumors.
    * When the eggs did not work, Reidoth went to the Emerald Enclave to be cared for until his death.
        * There he met with **Berinon** and described the PCs quest and circumstances.

<div class="flavor">

[**Why Reidoth sent them:**]

Another member of **Berinon**'s group steps forward and lowers her hood. She is an Elven woman who introduces herself as **Alotel Mithanmyr**. She has dark brown skin and her tightly curled hair is drawn back into a bun that rests on the top of her head. "It is time for you to prove your loyalty to the Emerald Enclave, Springwardens." She looks beyond you to the entrance of Wave Echo Cave and a smile parts her lips. "It is evident that your group is adept at cleansing the forces that would seek to disrupt the balances of nature."

"We come to you with a request handed down from lofty heights. The lord protector of **Neverwinter**, **Dagult Verember**, wishes to celebrate the restoration of his city with the return of his ancestor's famous sword. Lady Alagondar's longsword. Over a century ago, **Lady Tanamere Alagondar** slew a dragon named **Azdraka** that was terrorizing the **High Road**. She succumbed to wounds sustained during the battle and was buried there with the dragon. That place, now known as **Dragon Barrow**, contains the sword Lady Alagondar used that day to slay Azdraka."

"Normally the Emerald Enclave does not entertain the wishes of nobility, however this aligns with the goals of the Enclave. Dragon Barrow is a twisted and dangerous location that has for decades attracted spirits and unnatural creatures. Azdraka's power still haunts this place and upsets the natural balance of nature there. Cleansing Dragon Barrow while returning the sword will kill two birds with one stone. It will also earn you the powerful favor of Lord Verember. Within the Enclave, you will also earn a promotion. Do this and you will both attain the rank of Summerstriders."
</div>

#### **_QUEST: RETRIEVE LADY ALAGONDAR'S SWORD FROM DRAGON BARROW_**

* PCs will earn **100 gp**, a favor from **Lord Verember** (removing Xanaphia's warrant?), and the next rank within EE.
    * Must return sword to Lord Verember.
    * Having the ear and favor of lords like Verember can yield many lucrative benefits.
    * Due to their dragon fighting, the PCs were sought for this.
* Lord Verember of Neverwinter is celebrating the completed restoration of his city, and wishes to return an ancestor's artifact in order to celebrate this.
    * _IF PCs accept_: Dragon Barrow is added to the map. Quest is made active. A letter bearing Dagult Verember's seal is given over containing conference of authority to take the Sword and bring it to Castle Never.
    * _IF PCs refuse_: Lyraethyl & Qyryz's membership within the EE is revoked. EE demands return of the insignia for the Emerald Enclave.

#### **PHANDALIN**:

* _If PCs return to **Phandalin** they are stopped outside of town by two separate check points that block the small dirt road into town.
    * The first checkpoint is set up by two guards that look like farmers in scrapped together gear loyal to **Harbin Wester**. (Wyatt Turner & Kennett Anncroft)
    * The second checkpoint is set up by five more guards wearing **blue cloaks** of Sildar Hallwinter's police forced and are loyal to **Halia Thornton**. If questioned about the previous checkpoint, Corporal Grand Fieldmaster of the Fourth Phandalin Regiment Comstock Parr comes forward. (The rest do not give their names and are much more brusk)
        * Parr admits Wester has returned to town and is causing quite a headache for Thornton's administration. Populace is quite split in their allegiances.
        * Parr warns PCs not to aid the "usurper" Wester.
    * Both claim to be authorized by the true Phandalin Townmaster. Both ask for the PCs business entering the town and charge 5 cp the pass. As long as PCs do not instigate a fight with either checkpoint and give any sort of believable story for their entry, they are allowed into town.
    * Neither is willing to comment on the other checkpoint, only to insist they are loyal to the wrong authority.

#### **In Phandalin**

* **Harbin Wester** is back in town and has taken up residence in **Sister Garaele's** old home.
    * Wester was unable to rouse a posse in **Triboar** in order to take back his position as Townmaster in Phandalin in force.
    * After quickly wearing out his welcome there, he returned to **Phandalin** in the dead of night and set up an office in his new home as "Townmaster-in -Exile". A freshly painted sign above his entry reads "Official Phandalin Townmaster's Hall. Office of Townmaster Harbin Wester."
* The original townmaster's hall is unchanged esxcept for blue-cloaked guards standing at the entrance.

#### Wester's Office
<div className="flavor">

Inside the small home, several pieces of worn and rickety pieces of furniture make up the office of someone who wishes to appear much busier than they actually are. Several stacks of paper ornament Wester's desk and he looks up at your group as you open the front door. A small bell gives a half-hearted chime before falling to the ground next to ypour feet.

"Oh, my adventurers! Come from exotic locales no doubt and here to check on your beloved Phandalin. Come, come, let your townmaster welcome you properly." The fat old man stands and waves his hand over several mismatched chairs in front of his desk, waiting for each of you to take a seat.
</div>

* Harbin Wester is found inside his new office maintaining an artificial sense of importance and authenticity. He recognizes and welcomes the party happily and makes no mention of Halia Thornton or Phandalin's present divide. He makes sure to thank Lyraethyl for her "donation" and apoligizes that he is not currently able to repay her kindness. If asked, he admits that Thornton is still pretending to run the town but that "soon that will be in the past."
* Wester will ask the party to visit Qelline Alderleaf. Qelline's son, Carp, has recently gone missing and is desperate for someone to find the boy. Wester can offer no reward as "the town's budget is stretched thin as it is." (He has no access to the town's budget and is only referring to funds he's secured from loyal Phandalinians eager to have him restored as townmaster.) He is sure that Qelline will be able to provide something for the party's services.

#### **_QUEST: CHECK ON QELLINE ALDERLEAF AND HER SON, CARP._**


#### Thornton's Office
* Halia Thornton is constantly orbited by a crowd of guards who never leave her side. They look forward and do not interact with the party except at Thornton's order. Thornton is busy trying to put together a feast to celebrate the town's fourth founding anniversary, but is having trouble getting many of the town's citizenry to provide goods for the festivities. She suspects that Wester is the source of these problems. Thornton is looking for any opportunity to cement her authority over Phandalin.
* If the party has not already spoken with Qelline Alderleaf, a guard enters Thornton's office while the party meets with her and mentions the "irate Alderleaf woman is here again." Thornton will sigh and tell the guard to send Qelline home with assurances that her concerns will be heard when Thornton has the time. "Boys go missing all the time. In all likelihood, the he will return in a few days with scrapes on his knees and fanciful stories of defeating an army of orcs in the woods."
* She mentions "new religious types" that have been coming around lately smelling of saltwater and dragging seaweed along with them.
* Thornton addresses Xanaphia directly and tells her that she is elated to hear of Reidoth's death, and that she now has another opportunity to prove her usefulness to the Zhentarim that will earn her a promotion within the organization. If Harbin Wester is "dealt with" in a way that does not point back to Thornton she will make available the ruins of Tresendar Manor for the party, free of charge. He is making it impossible to govern the town effectively, delegitimizes her rightful authority, and is a corrupt man who will not stop until he has Phandalin in his pocket once more.
* If the party outright refuses the job, OR if the party agrees and then goes more than a tenday without completing the job, Thornton writes to Lorcan Merriweather in Waterdeep that she has found Xanaphia Umara. Merriweather will arrive a tenday after that with a small army to take Xanaphia captive.

#### **_QUEST: ASSASSINATE HARBIN WESTER_**

#### Qelline Alderleaf's Home
<div className="flavor">

The door to Qelline Alderleaf's farm home hangs open. Inside the darkened entry you can hear the desperate sobs of Qelline from somewhere deeper in the house. Inside, the home is a wreck. The floor is strewn with trash and furniture is toppled over as if someone has been looking frantically for something. Hearing your approach, a distrauht Qelline Alderleaf hangs her head out of the bedroom doorway sniffling and reeking of alcohol. She recognizes you and stumbles into the hallway, her face a shattered reflection of grief. Running up to Edgarr, she crumbles into his arms and sobs in his chest about her missing son.
</div>

* Qelline is found distraught at her home. She has been drinking and her hair and dress suggest she has been in this state for some time. She is at her wit's end because her boy, Carp, has run away from home.
    * He disappeared five days ago.
    * He took no food and no clothes beyond his wooden sword and what he had been wearing.
    * Carp has always wanted to become an adventurer and often lets his imagination lead him into dangerous situations (he discovered the secret entrance to the Redbrands' hideout under Tresendar Manor).
    * Lately he has been speaking of a "Lady in the Shadows" who needs him to rescue her. Qelline had just taken this to be the workings of a young imagination. She shows the party a drawing of a woman colored all in black with tears springing from her face surrounded by dark trees with monsters' eyes looking around her.
    * Qelline fears Carp has gone into the Neverwinter Wood on some dreamed-up adventure. She has no means of grand reward, but tells the adventurers that if they can safely bring back the boy she will never refuse the party in any request they give her for the rest of her life.
    * It is not known who Carp's father is. If asked Qelline will look embarrassed that she met the Human man in a tavern some years ago. He was very handsome and expressed an interest in Halfling women. He was gone the next day and she later had Carp.

<div class="callout">

Carp is the offspring of a Doppelganger. Carp's father was a shapeshifter who impregnated Qelline before leaving town.

Carp has stayed in his Halfling form all his life and is only beginning to reach the age in which his shapeshifting abilities will begin to express themselves.

Carp lives his life as an adventurer, going on many quests throughout the Forgotten Realms. In his adventuring, he came across a Djinn who granted him a single wish. Carp, now in his 30s wishes to once more have peace in his life. The Djinn transports Carp back in time to before he had ever become an adventurer. Now he lives in seclusion going by the name Falcon, knowing too much about the future and terrified of further altering the timeline.

#### **_QUEST: FIND AND RESCUE CARP ALDERLEAF_**

#### Sildar Hallwinter's Home
* Sildar can be found maintaining the orchard he inherited when he moved into Daran Edermath's home.
    * Largely retired, he welcomes the party with open arms and offers them some cider he has brewed on the premises and has named Edermath Cider.
    * His allegiances to the two townmasters is tepid, and while he does reckon that Halia's position holds more authority than Wester's, he doesn't think either is best suited for the job.
    * He mentions that a good townmaster should work to make sure that the basic needs of the townspeople were met instead of ever-increasing police-presence.
* If asked about Carp's disappearance, Sildar mentions that this isn't the first time the boy has tried running off recently. Just a tenday before this most recent disappearance a group of travelers came to town with Carp in tow after finding him wandering eastward barefoot along the Triboar Trail.
    * Sildar mentions that one of the travelers pulled him aside and mentioned that Carp had been found muttering in an unknown language in a trance-like state.
    * This detail Sildar kept from Qelline so as to not worry her. He privately suspected that the boy might be under the influence of the banshee Auglatha, but has no evidence to prove it.

#### Stonehill Inn
* The party may return to the Stonehill Inn where Carp's friend, Pip, lives with his family, the Stonehills.
    * Pip is not worried about Carp. "He's rescuing the Lady in the woods," the boy insists.
    * He is jealous that his friend is becoming an adventurer without him.
    * Carp has told Pip that the Lady lived in a big wooden mansion.
