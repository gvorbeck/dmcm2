title: 0.1. intro planning
---
- 1.0 - The party leaves Wave Echo Cave and returns to Phandalin.
  - 1.1 - Before reaching the village, the party comes upon a small checkpoint blocking the dirt road into Phandalin. There are two guards, Wyatt Turner and Kennett AnnCroft who ask the party's business in Phandalin on orders of Townmaster Harbin Wester. All travellers are to be questioned on their business before entry. The guards have no special clothing and look a bit like farmers.
    - 1.1.1 - As long as the party does not try to instigate a confrontation and gives any sort of reason for their entry, they are permitted to enter. They are warned not to cause trouble.
  - 1.2 - Just over the following hill, the party comes upon ANOTHER checkpoint manned by five more guards. These wear the blue cloaks of Sildar Hallwinter's Phandalin police force. These guards do not give their names if asked and are much more brusk. They do not acknowledge the previous checkpoint or its authority. They ask the party what they business in Phandalin is, just as the previous guards did, but this time it is on the authority of Townmaster Halia Thornton. If questioned about this, Corporal Grand Fieldmaster of the Fourth Phandalin Regiment Comstock Parr comes forward.
    - 1.2.1 - Parr admits that Wester has returned to Phandalin and claims to be the rightful townmaster of Phandalin while townmaster Thornton still officially holds the title. The people of Phandalin are split in their allegiances and the town is becoming increasingly divided. As long as the party does not try to instigate a confrontation and gives any sort of reason for their entry, they are permitted to enter. They are again warned not to cause trouble or aid the "usurper" Harbin Wester.
- 2.0 - The party arrives in Phandalin. There they can travel to any part of the village as before. They will notice that the former home of Sister Garaele now has a freshly painted sign outside reading "Official Phandalin Townmaster's Hall. Office of Townmaster Harbin Wester." The original townmaster's hall is unchanged esxcept for blue-cloaked guards standing at the entrance.
  - 2.1a - TM WESTER'S OFFICE: Harbin Wester is found inside his new office maintaining an artificial sense of importance and authenticity. He recognizes and welcomes the party happily and makes no mention of Halia Thornton or Phandalin's present divide. He makes sure to thank Lyraethyl for her "donation" and apoligizes that he is not currently able to repay her kindness. If asked, he admits that Thornton is still pretending to run the town but that "soon that will all pass."
    - 2.1a.1 - If given the opportunity, Wester will ask the party to visit Qelline Alderleaf. Qelline's son, Carp, has recently gone missing and is desperate for someone to find the boy. Wester can offer no reward as "the town's budget is stretched thin as it is." (He has no access to the town's budget and is only referring to funds he's secured from loyal Phandalinians eager to have him restored as townmaster.) He is sure that Qelline will be able to provide something for the party's services.
  - 2.1b - TM THORNTON'S OFFICE: Halia Thornton is constantly orbited by a crowd of guards who never leave her side. They look forward and do not interact with the party except at Thornton's order. Thornton is busy trying to put together a feast to celebrate the town's fourth founding anniversary, but is having trouble getting many of the town's citizenry to provide goods for the festivities. She suspects that Wester is the source of these problems. Thornton is looking for any opportunity to cement her authority over Phandalin.
    - 2.1b.1 - If the party has not already spoken with Qelline Alderleaf, a guard enters Thornton's office while the party meets with her and mentions the "irate Alderleaf woman is here again." Thornton will sigh and tell the guard to send Qelline home with assurances that her concerns will be heard when Thornton has the time. "Boys go missing all the time. In all likelihood, the he will return in a few days with scrapes on his knees and fanciful stories of defeating an army of orcs in the woods."
    - 2.1b.2 - Thornton addresses Xanaphia directly and tells her that while she is disappointed that Xanaphia did not kill Reidoth, that she now has another opportunity to prove her usefulness to the Zhentarim. If Harbin Wester is "dealt with" in a way that does not point back to Thornton she will make available the ruins of Tresendar Manor for the party, free of charge. He is making it impossible to govern the town effectively, delegitimizes her rightful authority, and is a corrupt man who will not stop until he has Phandalin in his pocket once more.
      - 2.1b.2.1 - If the party outright refuses the job, OR if the party agrees and then goes more than a tenday without completing the job, Thornton writes to Lorcan Merriweather in Waterdeep that she has found Xanaphia Umara. Merriweather will arrive a tenday after that with a small army to take Xanaphia captive.
  - 2.1c - QELLINE ALDERLEAF'S HOME: Qelline is found distraught at her home. She has been drinking and her hair and dress suggest she has been in this state for some time. She is at her wit's end because her boy, Carp, has run away from home. He disappeared five days ago. He took no food and no clothes beyond his wooden sword and what he had been wearing. Carp has always wanted to become an adventurer and often lets his imagination lead him into dangerous situations (he discovered the secret entrance to the Redbrands' hideout under Tresendar Manor). Lately he has been speaking of a "Lady in the Shadows" who needs him to rescue her. Qelline had just taken this to be the workings of a young imagination. She shows the party a drawing of a woman colored all in black with tears springing from her face surrounded by dark trees with monsters' eyes looking around her. Qelline fears Carp has gone into the Neverwinter Wood on some dreamed-up adventure. She has no means of grand reward, but tells the adventurers that if they can safely bring back the boy she will never refuse the party in any request they give her for the rest of her life. She then passes out from drink.
    - 2.1c.1 - It is not known who Carp's father is. If asked Qelline will look embarrassed that she met the Human man in a tavern some years ago. He was very handsome and expressed an interest in Halfling women. He was gone the next day and she later had Carp.
      - MAYBE CARP IS A DOPPELGANGER WHO HAS BEGUN TO CHANGE.
      - MAYBE CARP'S FATHER IS SOMEONE IMPORTANT.

  - 2.1d - SILDAR HALLWINTER'S HOME: Sildar can be found maintaining the orchard he inherited when he moved into Daran Edermath's home. Largely retired, he welcomes the party with open arms and offers them some cider he has brewed on the premises and has named Edermath Cider. His allegiances to the two townmasters is tepid, and while he does reckon that Halia's position holds more authority than Wester's, he doesn't think either is best suited for the job. He mentions that if he were in the position that he would work to make sure that the basic needs of the townspeople were met instead of ever-increasing police-presence.
    - 2.1d.1 - Sildar mentions that as part of his retirement from adventuring, he has given up his position within the Lords' Alliance. Sildar would like to offer the faction a replacement when he retires and asks Edgarr and Astra of their interest in joining the Lords' Alliance. Should they express interest, he has one task for them to complete. The Lords' Alliance has asked for the return of Lady Tanamere Alagondar's sword, which helped slay the green dragon Azdraka in this region about a century ago. Her descendants wish to return the sword to the family's grand hall now that it has been rebuilt in Neverwinter. https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/doip/dragon-barrow
      - 2.1d.1.1 - This is a trifling matter and if the party brings up the missing Carp, Sildar assures them that this task can wait if they intent to rescue the boy.
      - 2.1d.2 - It is at this location that Zoot will collapse. Its leaves begin to yellow and he becomes unresponsive. Sildar kneels down and inspects the plant and asks what it came into contact with within the mine at Wave Echo Cave. The Ochre Jelly that Zoot raked to death has infected the plant and it will die if not treated. Sildar offers to look after the plant for a time until Zoot can recover.
      - 2.1d.3 - If asked about Carp's disappearance, Sildar mentions that this isn't the first time the boy has tried running off recently. Just a tenday before this most recent disappearance a group of travelers came to town with Carp in tow after finding him wandering eastward barefoot along the Triboar Trail. Sildar mentions that one of the travelers pulled him aside and mentioned that Carp had been found muttering in an unknown language in a trance-like state. This detail Sildar kept from Qelline so as to not worry her. He privately suspected that the boy might be under the influence of the banshee Auglatha, but has no evidence to prove it.
  - 2.1e - STONEHILL INN: The party may return to the Stonehill Inn where Carp's friend, Pip, lives with his family, the Stonehills. Pip is not worried about Carp. "He's rescuing the Lady in the woods," the boy insists. He is jealous that his friend is becoming an adventurer without him. Pip knows that Carp is after the mysterious "Lady in the Shadows." Pip says he's seen her before when Carp showed her to him. "She seemed so sad," is all he can say to describe her. Carp has told Pip that the Lady lived in a big wooden mansion.

  - 1.1 - Before reaching the village they are stopped by a checkpoint asking their business. Townmaster Wester is currently
    - There are currently TWO individuals claiming to be townmasters of Phandalin:
      - Harbin Wester, who was the original townmaster and had been since the town was resettled in the past 4 years. He was recently run out of town by an angry mob led by Halia Thornton. It was discovered that Wester was hoarding treasure found in the cellars of Tresendar Manor. That treasure originally belonged to the townspeople of Phandalin. Edgarr had made Wester promise to redistribute that wealth when the party had removed the Redbrands from town.
        - When the town ran Wester out of Phandalin, Halia Thorntoin held a hastily organized election which installed her as the towns new townmaster. It is not clear how legitimate this election was as Halia is a member of the Zhentarim, a group that bends the rules to achieve power.
        - The party ran into Wester along the Triboar Trail. He had just been run out of town and was going to the village of Triboar in order to gather a posse of vigilantes who would aid him in restoring his position within Phandalin. The party refuses to help Wester in his mission, but allows the old man to camp with them for the night. They awake that morning to discover that Wester had stolen a piece of gold from Lyraethyl before running off in the night.

**_ADULT CARP_**
carp relates story:
I was a quiet boy, terrified of the world. I would never leave my mother's side no matter how difficult she was when drunk. 'Better the devil you know than the devil you don't' I always thought. It all changed one day when I was with my mother in the market. A man, big and strong, was haggling with a fruit vendor. He radiated confidence and yet still exuded kindness. I remember the sword across his back blinded me when the sun's reflection shone on its blade. I knew he didn't live in Phandalin. I hid behind my mother and listened intently at his stories of danger and excitement trying to get the fruit vendor to accept forgeign coin for his goods. Eventually the man noticed me and stopped in his tracks. He knelt down and looked me straight into my eyes and said, "I know you. Youre Carp Alderleaf aren't you." I was floored. An adventurer had come to town and he knew my name. I was speechless. He said to me after a moment, "I know the world is a scary place, young Carp. But I have something for you, if you'll take it." He handed me a wooden sword.

From then on I never feared again. With that sword in my hand I ruled the world in my mind. Nothing could defeat me and I knew that one day I would be come just like that man.

When I found myself out of time and back on the Sword Coast, I came back to Phandalin, to the place I last saw my mother, hoping she would still be here, still alive. She was. Young as I ever remembered her. Drunk as I ever remembered her. But still she was there in front of me. and so was I. The young me. The nervous terrified child. Hungry, I tried to buy an apple but only had southern coin in my purse and the vendor would not take my coin. It was deja vu. I looked over and saw my younger self staring out at me from behind his mother's apron. I called the boy over. I gave himn my practice sword.

It was only afterward that I realized what I had done. I had set myself on the course of my own life. That boy would now be unafraid, but also, he would disappear into the woods and never be seen again. I had completed the loop before I had even realized. I vowed then that I could not cause any more grief and left Phandalin forever. And here I have been ever since.
