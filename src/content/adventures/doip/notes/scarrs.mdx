Castle Never was an imposing building, a testament to the city's architectural achievements. The three landmarks of the city—the Dolphin, the Winged Wyvern, and the Sleeping Dragon Bridges—radiated around the castle, connecting it with the southwestern district.[1][3]

The Castle was heavily damaged by the eruption of Mount Hotenow in 1451 DR, and most of its towers and walls crumbled, as well as some of its interior rooms, halls and corridors. Being built on an strong foundation, however, the rest of the castle was left mostly intact.[2] As of 1489 DR, Castle Never was still in ruins.[6]

* The immense structure flows over the cliffside coast of the Neverwinter River.
* After taking severe damage in the eruption of Mt. Hotenow decades ago, many of its tower and walls crumbled, scattering themselves into the river that flowed black with ash.
* Dagult Verember has spent much of his tenure as Lord Protector of Neverwinter and Warden of the North rebuilding the city and Castle Never to its former glory. A task he has finally achieved.
* Presenting the guards at the castle's gates with the sword and Verember's seal gets you quickly ushered through a series of entryways until you enter a grand chamber decorated with a series of bright and ornately designed tapestries. Before you, seated on a grand throne is Dagult Verember who is surrounded by advisors and his personal guards.

* Verember thanks for sword.
* Nasher Alagondar is brought out to witness the sword and confirm its authenticity.
* PCs are paid handsomely and Dagult assures the PCs they can have an audience with him at any point in the future should they need the ear of the warden of the north.
* Dagult then introduces them to _____ who leads a new guild put together by Verember, the Sword Coast Artifacts Research and Requisition Society, or SCARRS. Part of restoring the north is also routing out the dangerous magical artifacts that litter the landscape. Curses and creatures stalk nearly every inch of the land and if we are ever to truly guarantee the safety of our people, we can't be afraid that every goblet or gravestone isn't hiding some new awful terror that will destroy the progress we march toward every day.
* mentions growing cult acitivity. when people are scared they lack confidence in earthly solutions, often burying their heads in the sands of some new zealotry.
* there are several other artifacts that SCARRS would like to have retrieved:
- the helm of talos, located in Axehelm
- ha

* a strange ship was seen off the coast of Neverwinter a few tendays ago, since then strange storms have been reported in the Neverwinter Wood. these could be unrelated but my dreams of late have been haunted with visions of an evil one-eyed being. my advisor _____ tells me this may be the visage of the evil storm god, Talos. If a Talosian cult were to gain a foothold on the SW now, I fear for the progress we have made these past few decades. go to axeholm and remove the helm of talos.
