* Former Townmaster of Phandalin. Ousted by Halia Thornton after it was discovered Wester had been embezzling treasure found by PCs in Tresendar Manor. His home was burned down and was run out of town.
* Asked PCs to clear Wyvern Tor in LMoP.
* Knows Xanaphia is wanted.
* Stole 1 gp from Lyraethyl when he camped with PCs while on his way to Triboar to hire a posse in order to restore his position as Townmaster.
* He was unable to hire a posse and so has returned to Phandalin quietly and set up an office in protest within Sister Garaele's old home.
